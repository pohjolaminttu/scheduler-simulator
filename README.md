# scheduler-simulator

A (computing) scheduler simulator / design. Done as a course assignment for "Computer Architecture and Operating Systems" 2025, Turun Yliopisto.

To run the whole program, I suggest to run scheduler first in the backgroud "./scheduler &" and then the handler in the same terminal "./handler"

I chose C for this task because I thought it had the clearest structure for this kind of task. Also, I haven’t coded much in C, so I wanted to challenge myself.”
